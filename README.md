Chilibasket's walle with oLED support

Based on https://github.com/chillibasket/walle-replica

This only has a slightly modified Arduino code.

Support BW oLED displays using u8g2 library. It has been tested with a 128x64 pixel SH1106 screen from Aliexpress, but others should work as well.
It requires the battery meter as described in chillibasket's project.

#define OLED enables the functionality
